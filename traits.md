# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior
We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic can be any type that has certain behavior.

Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although with some differences.

## Defining a Trait

    fn main() {
      pub trait Summary {
        // A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
      }
    }

## Implementing a Trait on a Type

    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }

    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }

    pub struct Tweet {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub retweet: bool,
    }

    impl Summary for Tweet {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }

Call the methods on instances of NewsArticle and Tweet in the same way we call regular methods:

    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());

## Default Implementations

    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            String::from("(Read more...)")
        }
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    // To use a default implementation to summarize instances of NewsArticle 
    // instead of defining a custom implementation, we specify an empty impl block
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {}
    
    let article = NewsArticle {
        headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
        location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
        author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
        content: String::from(
            "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
             hockey team in the NHL.",
        ),
    };

    // This code prints New article available! (Read more...)
    println!("New article available! {}", article.summarize());

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods donâ€™t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify a small part of it. 

    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
        }
    }
    
    pub struct Tweet {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub retweet: bool,
    }
    
    // To use this version of Summary, we only need to define summarize_author when we implement the trait on a type
    // No need to impl default implementations
    impl Summary for Tweet {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
            format!("@{}", self.username)
        }
    }
    
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    // This code prints 1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...).
    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
