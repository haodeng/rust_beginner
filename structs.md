# Structs
## Defining and Instantiating Structs
    struct User {
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
        active: bool,
    }

We create an instance by stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing key: value pairs

    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    
    println!("{}", user1.email); // To get value, use dot notation

To set value, struct need to be mutable

    // the entire instance must be mutable
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");

## Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name

    // having to repeat the email and username field names and variables is a bit tedious.
    // thereâ€™s a convenient shorthand!
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            email: email,
            username: username,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }

    fn build_user_simple(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            // Because the email field and the email parameter have the same name, we only need to write email rather than email: email
            email,
            username,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    
## Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

    let user5 = User {
        email: String::from("another5@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername5"),
        active: user1.active,
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
    
    // The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set
    // should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.
    let user6 = User {
        email: String::from("another6@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername6"),
        ..user1
    };
